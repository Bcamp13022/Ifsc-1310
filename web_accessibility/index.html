            <h2>Why is Web Accessibility Important to Users?</h2>
        </header>
        <p>There are a lot of users that have disabilities/impairments that cause them to not be able to access a webpage that a person without these limitations normally would. It is imperative that we restructure and update webpages to be more inclusive because not only will it increase foot traffic among the disabled persons community, but it will also show that the company or organization that owns the site is inclusive and welcoming of people that are not able to access the site traditionally.</p> <p>I believe that everyone should be able to have access to modern technology because it is a necessity of life this day in age compared to when the internet first became popular. People use the internet for all sorts of things including work, social media, hobbies, to order meals/groceries, etc. To not allow an individual or group of individuals access to these necessities would be inhumane.</p><p>Thankfully these obstacles have been met and overcome due to more and more awarness being shared about the necessity of Web Accessibility.</p>

            <h3>Why Must Websites Adopt Accessibility?</h3>
        </header>
        <p>According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2023/03/20/understanding-the-importance-of-web-accessibility/?sh=2cb9d223377f" target="_blank">Forbes</a>, <q>One of the main reasons for the importance of website accessibility is the growing number of people with disabilities. According to the World Health organization and the CDC, 16% of the world's population, and 26% of the U.S. population, have a disability.</q> This growing number has resulted in the need for more sites to implement user accessibility in order for their business, organization, or group to reach more than a quarter of the U.S. Population.</p><p>It is hard for non-disabled users to comprehend the struggles that disabled users face when trying to navigate sites that have limited to zero accessibility and that's why, during the age of the internet, we are able to access reading materials and personal experiences so we can understand and sympathize with disabled users and create a more user friendly software for a better tomorrow.</p>
